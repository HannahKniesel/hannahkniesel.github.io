            <h3>Lecture: Digital Media</h3>
        <p>
          I currently accompany the lecture "Digital Media" and "Basics of Media Informatics" for bachelor (undergrad) students 
          held by <a href="https://viscom.uni-ulm.de/members/timo-ropinski/">Timo Ropinski</a> at Ulm University. 
          I supervise and create exercises about different types of media, as well as their encoding and representation.
          We also include basics of deep neural networks in the lecture.

            <h3>Projects and Thesis: Deep Learning for Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>
          I offer the supervision and mentoring of bachelor (undergrad) and master (grad) students in regular projects/theses. 
          Project ideas are designed and formed in cooperation with the students. 
          I accompany and support the students during the implementation and finally guide through the documentation and writing phase.

            <h3>Seminar: Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>
          I design, implement and accompany the seminar for bachelor (undergrad) students. During this seminar, we give a short introduction into current reseach in computer vision, dominated by deep learning. 
          Students are then guided through the process of reading topic specific academic papers and related work, writing their own academic paper and finally mimicing the review process of 
          conference submissions.
